      "contents": "\nHello! Welcome to MMM Lab in the Department of Psychology at the\nUniversity of Southern California (USC). We develop and evaluate methods\nin Measurement and Multilevel Modeling. Measurement is the foundation of\nquantitative science, and it’s especially important in psychological and\nsocial sciences as data in psychology is usually noisy and not perfectly\nreliable. Multilevel modeling is an extremely powerful framework with\nvery broad applications for quantitative science.\nCheck out our Research page for specific\nprojects. We do statistical derivation, Monte Carlo simulations, and\ninnovative applications of cutting-edge methods. We mainly use R, but\ncurrently we’re also learning Julia.\nInterested in collaboration or have any questions? Feel free to email\nus.\n MMM Lab meeting during #quarantine\n\n\n\n",

I\nam from Macau and speaks Cantonese as my native language. Mathematics\nhas always been a favorite subject to me, but my growing interest in\nunderstanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor degree in\nPsychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a career\nof developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences\nwould be a very good fit to me.\nI am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my\nresearch areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation\nmodeling, effect size statistics, and measurement invariance. I also\nhave collaborations on projects studying the prevalence, antecedents and\nconsequences of gambling disorder, and in other areas such as\nevolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental sciences,\nhealth sciences, etc.\nCV\nPersonal website\nEmail: hokchiol@usc.edu\nGraduate Students\nWinnie Wing-Yee Tse\n\n\n\nI am a third-year Ph.D. quantitative psychology student, working\nunder the supervision of Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai. Broadly speaking, my\nresearch interests are on multilevel modeling, structural equation\nmodeling, and Bayesian statistics. My main project focuses on\nincorporating uncertainty in parameter values (e.g., effect size and\nintraclass correlation) for designing multilevel studies. My secondary\nproject investigates when strict factorial invariance is a necessary\ncondition for valid use of observed scale scores. I am also involved in\nprojects on latent class/profile analysis, two-stage path analysis with\nadjustment for measurement noninvariance and unreliability, and\nmultilevel regression and poststratification on subnational predictions\nwith language data.\nCV\nPersonal website\nEmail: wingyeet@usc.edu\nYichi Zhang\n\nHello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology. I\nam co-advised by Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai and Dr. Rand Wilcox. My current\nresearch interests are measurement invariance, robust structural\nequation modeling and longitudinal growth modeling. My current project\nis about establishing measurement invariance using a Bayesian ROME\n(region of measurement equivalence) method.\nCV\nEmail: yzhang97@usc.edu\nJimmy Zhang\n\n\n\nResearch Interests: Factor Analysis, Measurement Invariance,\nMeta-analysis\nEmail: gengruiz@usc.edu\nMeltem Ozcan\n\nI am a first-year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology at USC\nadvised by Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai. Broadly, I am interested in the\ndevelopment and application of advanced quantitative methods to assess\nand model dynamic and complex psychological phenomena, and more\nspecifically, my research interests include measurement bias, Bayesian\nstatistics, and psychometrics. At UC Santa Cruz, where I completed my\nM.S. in statistics, my research looked at the performance of the\ncumulative sum test for determining changepoints in time series under\nvarious correlation structures through a series of simulation\nexperiments. Previously, I conducted research on an eclectic set of\ntopics I find fascinating, including self-disclosure, intimacy,\n(skipping the) small talk, influence attempts in friendships on topics\nsuch as politics, linguistic patterns in trauma narratives, and light\ntherapy for PTSD. I enjoy hiking, road trips, horror movies, reading,\nlearning languages (Korean or Python), writing (stories or code), and\nskipping the small talk.\nEmail: ozcan@usc.edu\nPersonal website: https://www.linkedin.com/in/meltemozcan/\nUndergraduate Students\nHailin Yue (Haley)\nI am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in economics, with\na minor in psychology and data analytics. I am interested in applying\nquantitative reasoning to study mental health and to optimize business\ndecision I hope to pursue a graduate degree after graduation, but am not\nsure on what subject yet. Outside of academia, I enjoy reading,\npainting, listening to music, and watching TV dramas.\nEmail: hailinyu@usc.edu\nClay Cantrell\nI am a fourth year undergraduate student studying Cognitive Science\nwith a minor in Computer Programming at USC. My academic interests\ninclude computer-human interaction and social learning. When I’m not in\nfront of a computer my hobbies include mountain bike riding,\nbackpacking, and getting some fresh air.\nEmail: cacantre@usc.edu\nAlyssa Delarosa\nEmail: alyssad1@usc.edu\nCollaborators\nHio Wa (Grace) Mak (U Southern\nCalifnoria)\nGeorge\nRichardson (U Cincinnati)\nYu-Yu Hsiao (U New Mexico)\nLab Alumni\nYuting Wang\n\n\n\n",
