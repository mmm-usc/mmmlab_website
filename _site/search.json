      "contents": "\nHello! Welcome to MMM Lab in the Department of Psychology at the University of Southern California (USC). We develop and evaluate methods in Measurement and Multilevel Modeling. Measurement is the foundation of quantitative science, and it’s especially important in psychological and social sciences as data in psychology is usually noisy and not perfectly reliable. Multilevel modeling is an extremely powerful framework with very broad applications for quantitative science.\nCheck out our Research page for specific projects. We do statistical derivation, Monte Carlo simulations, and innovative applications of cutting-edge methods. We mainly use R, but currently we’re also learning Julia.\nInterested in collaboration or have any questions? Feel free to email us.\n MMM Lab meeting during #quarantine\n\n\n\n",

I am from Macau and speaks Cantonese as my native language. Mathematics has always been a favorite subject to me, but my growing interest in understanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor degree in Psychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a career of developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences would be a very good fit to me.\nI am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my research areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size statistics, and measurement invariance. I also have collaborations on projects studying the prevalence, antecedents and consequences of gambling disorder, and in other areas such as evolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental sciences, health sciences, etc.\nCV\nPersonal website\nEmail: hokchiol@usc.edu\nGraduate Students\nWinnie Wing-Yee Tse\n\n\n\nI am a third-year Ph.D. quantitative psychology student, working under the supervision of Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai. My main research interest is on statistical models within the framework of structural equation modeling, particularly with dichotomous and polytomous variables. My current project focuses on demonstrating the necessity of strict factorial invariance prior to mean comparisons across groups with ordered-categorical variables.\nIn my leisure time, I enjoy watching fantasy/mystery/horror movies, TV series, and video gameplays (basically anything with a good storyline!).\nCV\nEmail: wingyeet@usc.edu\nYichi Zhang\n\nHello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology. I am co-advised by Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai and Dr. Rand Wilcox. My current research interests are measurement invariance, robust structural equation modeling and longitudinal growth modeling. My current project is about establishing measurement invariance using a Bayesian ROME (region of measurement equivalence) method.\nCV\nEmail: yzhang97@usc.edu\nJimmy Zhang\n\n\n\nResearch Interests: Factor Analysis, Measurement Invariance, Meta-analysis\nEmail: gengruiz@usc.edu\nMeltem Ozcan\n\nI am a first-year Ph.D. student in quantitative & computational psychology at USC advised by Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai. Broadly, I am interested in the development and application of advanced quantitative methods to assess and model dynamic and complex psychological phenomena, and more specifically, my research interests include measurement, Bayesian statistics, and psychometrics. My current research at UC Santa Cruz, where I’m wrapping up my M.S. in statistics, examines the performance of the cumulative sum test for determining changepoints in time series under various correlation structures through a series of simulation experiments. Previously, I conducted research on an eclectic set of topics I find fascinating, including self-disclosure, intimacy, (skipping the) small talk, influence attempts in friendships on topics such as politics, linguistic patterns in trauma narratives, and light therapy for PTSD. I enjoy hiking, road trips, horror movies, reading, learning languages (Korean or Python), writing (stories or code), and skipping the small talk.\nEmail: ozcan@usc.edu\nPersonal website: https://www.linkedin.com/in/meltemozcan/\nUndergraduate Students\nHailin Yue (Haley)\nI am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in economics, with a minor in psychology and data analytics. I am interested in applying quantitative reasoning to study mental health and to optimize business decision I hope to pursue a graduate degree after graduation, but am not sure on what subject yet. Outside of academia, I enjoy reading, painting, listening to music, and watching TV dramas.\nEmail: hailinyu@usc.edu\nClay Cantrell\nI am a fourth year undergraduate student studying Cognitive Science with a minor in Computer Programming at USC. My academic interests include computer-human interaction and social learning. When I’m not in front of a computer my hobbies include mountain bike riding, backpacking, and getting some fresh air.\nEmail: cacantre@usc.edu\nAlyssa Delarosa\nEmail: alyssad1@usc.edu\nCollaborators\nHio Wa (Grace) Mak (U Southern Califnoria)\nGeorge Richardson (U Cincinnati)\nYu-Yu Hsiao (U New Mexico)\nLab Alumni\nYuting Wang\n\n\n\n",
