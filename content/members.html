<section class="bio">
<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology (Quantitative Methods) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Southern California. I am from Macau and speaks Cantonese as my native language. Mathematics has always been a favorite subject to me, but my growing interest in understanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor degree in Psychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a career of developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences would be a very good fit to me.</p>
<p>I am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my research areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size statistics, and measurement invariance. I also have collaborations on projects studying the prevalence, antecedents and consequences of gambling disorder, and in other areas such as evolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental sciences, health sciences, etc.</p>

<p>I am a rising second year Ph.D. quantitative psychology student, working under the supervision of Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai. My main research interest is on statistical models within the framework of structural equation modeling, particularly with dichotomous and polytomous variables. My current project focuses on demonstrating the necessity of strict factorial invariance prior to mean comparisons across groups with ordered-categorical variables.</p>
<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy watching fantasy/mystery/horror movies, TV series, and video gameplays (basically anything with a good storyline!).</p>

<p>Hello! I am a rising second year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology. I am co-advised by Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai and Dr. Rand Wilcox. My current research interests are measurement invariance, robust structural equation modeling and longitudinal growth modeling. My current project is about establishing measurement invariance using a Bayesian ROME (region of measurement equivalence) method.</p>

<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in economics, with minors in psychology and data analytics. I am interested in applying a quantitative approach to study psychiatric disorders, and to optimize business decision. After graduation, I want to work as a consultant before going into grad school. In my leisure time, I enjoy music, fashion, painting, interior design, and watching tv dramas.</p>
